# matrixCalc
this is my first console matrix calculator
The calculator implements:
√ 1. Create matrices of N columns and M rows
√ 1.1. Fill in this matrix
√ 2. Transpose matrix A into matrix A
√ 4. Add matrices A and B
√ 5. Subtract matrices A and B
√ 6. Multiply matrices A and B
√ 7. Multiply matrix A and E (unit matrix)
√ 8. Multiplying matrix A by the number n
√ 9. Raise the matrix A to the power of n
√ 10. Search for the determinant of the matrix
√ 11. Create an inverse matrix
√ 12. Minor Search
√ 13. Search for an algebraic complement
